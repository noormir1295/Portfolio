This is my portfolio

# About Me
* I created my about me starting with the nav bar I took from bootstrap. I edited some styles on the nav with my own css that is linked within the html. 
* I created the about me page with a grid system that contains the header, a picture of myself, and a short paragraph about me. This grid system is made responsice so that it can be used in m
mulitple formats.
Footer was added into grid system as well.

# Portfolio 
* My portfolio index has the same nav html and css as About Me. I used a diferent style of grid for this page where there are multiple sub-rows and sub-columns on my page.
* I used responsive thumbnails for my pictures that I picked frombootstrap. Each card format was taken from bootstrap but was edited by myself through my own css that is linked in the html.

# Contact 
* Contact page uses a grid system taht is responsive. Had a contact form that contains Name, email, and a message. I used the same nav as the other two html (all linked together). 
* I also added a submit input within the form and the grid system.

# Assets
* Assets contain images I used for this project and screenshots of the responsive web pages.
